# Pokémon GO Pokédex

This app uses data from various sources to present information about a Pokémon's stats - skewed towards using the data during raids where I am contently asked if a specific pokemon is a hundo or fundo.

This app was almost completely written using cursor's "agent" mode to learn about the capabilities of current generation AI coding tools.

## Features

- Search functionality to find specific Pokémon
- Detailed view of each Pokémon's stats and raid information
- CP ranges for different encounter types

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eldarni/fundo.git
cd fundo
npm install
npm run start
```
